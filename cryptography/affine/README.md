# Affine Cipher

This folder contains my own implementation of the Affine cipher in Python.

## Encryption
Uses the formula E(x) = (a * x + b) mod 26 to encrypt text.

## Decryption
Reverses the encryption using the modular inverse of a.

## Important
The value of a must be coprime with 26.

## What I learned
- Modular arithmetic
- Modular inverses
- Mathematical constraints in cryptography
