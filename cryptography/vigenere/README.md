# Vigenère Cipher

This folder contains my own implementation of the Vigenère cipher in Python.

## How it works
The Vigenère cipher encrypts text using a repeating keyword.
Each letter in the keyword determines the shift applied to the corresponding
letter in the message.

## Encryption
Letters are shifted forward based on the alphabetical position of the keyword
letter.

## Decryption
Decryption reverses the process by shifting letters backward using the same key.

## What I learned
- Polyalphabetic encryption
- Key-based shifting
- Improving security over simple substitution ciphers
