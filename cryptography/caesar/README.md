# Caesar Cipher

This folder contains my own implementation of the Caesar cipher in Python.

## Encryption
The encryption script shifts each letter forward in the alphabet by a fixed number.
Modulo 26 is used to ensure letters wrap correctly from Z back to A.

## Decryption
The decryption script reverses the encryption process by shifting letters backward
using the same key.

## What I learned
- Modular arithmetic
- Character encoding
- Difference between symmetric and non-symmetric ciphers
