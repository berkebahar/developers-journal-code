# Binary Encoding

This folder contains my own implementation of text-to-binary encoding and decoding
using Python.

## Encoding
Each character is converted into its binary representation using ASCII values.

## Decoding
Binary values are grouped and converted back into readable text.

## Important note
Binary encoding is not encryption, as it does not provide secrecy, only representation.

## What I learned
- Character encoding
- Binary number systems
- Difference between encoding and encryption
