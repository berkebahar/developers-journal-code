# Prime Snake

## Overview
Prime Snake is a variation of the classic Snake game built using Python and Pygame. 
Instead of food, the snake navigates a grid containing both prime and composite numbers. 
The goal is to collect all prime numbers while avoiding non-prime numbers.

## Core Concepts
- Grid-based movement and collision detection
- Prime number identification
- Game loops and event handling
- Basic object-oriented design

## What I Learned
- How to implement grid-aligned movement using vectors
- How mathematical concepts like prime numbers can be integrated into gameplay
- The importance of separating game logic from utility functions

## Limitations and Future Improvements
- Prevent number spawning on the snake’s body
- Add a restart or game-over screen instead of immediate exit
- Improve difficulty progression and scoring mechanics
