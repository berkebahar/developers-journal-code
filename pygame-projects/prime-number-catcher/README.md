# Prime Number Catcher

Prime Number Catcher is a small game built using Python and Pygame.
The player controls a character at the bottom of the screen and must
catch falling prime numbers while avoiding non-prime numbers.

## How the game works
- Numbers fall from the top of the screen at random positions.
- Prime numbers increase the score.
- Non-prime numbers decrease the score.
- The game ends when the score reaches a win or loss threshold.

## Concepts explored
- Object-oriented programming (classes for game entities)
- Prime number detection using an optimized algorithm
- Event-driven programming with a game loop
- Collision detection and scoring logic
- Translating mathematical concepts into interactive systems

## Why I built this project
I wanted to combine mathematics and programming in a visual and
interactive way. Using prime numbers as a game mechanic helped me
understand how abstract mathematical ideas can be implemented as
algorithms inside a real-time program.

## Possible improvements
- Difficulty scaling over time
- Cleaner separation of game logic and mathematical logic
- Improved visuals and animations
