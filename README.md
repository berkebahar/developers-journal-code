# developers-journal-code
Code experiments and small projects documented alongside my Developer’s Journal.

This repository contains small coding experiments and practice projects.
Each project reflects a concept I am learning and is accompanied by
written reflections in my Developer’s Journal.

Relevant coursework and certificates are archived in the /certificates folder.

Focus areas:
- Problem decomposition
- Algorithmic thinking
- Clean and readable code
